## About
This _config_ is **focusing on optimal expereience** through gameplay. It works with **every computer** that can run the default game but, in same time it will **improve the frame rate** and improve the **in-game advantages**.

Everything inside this config is **documented**, **analyzed**, **tested** and there is **no misconception** about the commands. It _isn't based_ on guess, misconcepted community thoughts _but rather_ on well documented sources, the game's source code and on **my vastly experience** through Valve's Source games.

The _config_ is **often updated** with new commands (when the game is updated), new features (like scripts) and it is sometimes rewritten in some parts for a better template. If there is a critical bug, **i'll notice it immediately and patch it**.

#### The story

> Back around 2015, after seeing that there isn't a good config and most of them were full of non-sense, I decided that I need to write my own one. First, I analyzized the entire community, I documented myself (I wanted to expand my existing knowledge) and I searched for good templates. So, I started to write it. I rewrote it many times from scratch until I reached a good template and since then I have updated it to make it even better - At a first look it doesn't seem like something special but, after the effort spent on this project, I can only think of the contrary.

## Installation

##### Downloading and installing steps:
* [Download](https://github.com/ArmynC/ArminC-AutoExec/archive/master.zip) the config.
* **Go** to the following path: `\...\Steam\userdata\<Your_SteamID3>\730\local\`
* Place the **cfg** folder (from .zip) inside **local** folder (from path).
  * Replace all files if it ask.
* Set the **launch options** (_optional_).
  * Open **Steam**, right click **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** in the Steam _library_, click **Properties** and click the **Set Launch Options**.
  * In the box, **type** the launch options (_see them below_) and press **OK**.
* **Launch** the game and **type** in _console_ the following command: `exec autoexec.cfg`

##### Launch Options:
`-novid -tickrate 128 +exec autoexec.cfg`

**Informations**:

`-novid` **>>** Remove the Valve intro at the beginning.

`-tickrate 128` **>>** Created offline (bots) server will run at tickrate 128 instead of 64.

`+exec autoexec.cfg` **>>** Run the config at every startup (in case it is not running automatically).

-- In the community there are some **misconcepted** _launch options_, some of them can hurt the performance of the game or don't do anything (because that functions already exist). **I don't recommend other misconcepted launch options**.

##### How to find your SteamID3:

* **Go** to the following **site**: https://steamid.co
* In the **Input Box** (_top right_), **enter** your **profile** name/id.
* After that, a page with all of SteamIDs versions will be displayed, **ID3** is in a format like this: `[X:Y:ZZZZZZZZ]` - your install path id is the whole **Z** code.

##### Encountered problems?

Check out some [troubleshooting instructions](under_work).

##### Operating system optimizations
This config is already optimizing the game but, you can [improve the performance](under_work) at the OS level. 

## Updating

When a **new version** is out, you have **two methods** to _update_:

##### 1. You edited the config based on your preference:
* Check the new [commits](https://github.com/ArmynC/ArminC-AutoExec/commits/master) and **update** the config **manually** by relying on the _commits_.

##### 2. You didn't edited the config (or atleast a little bit):
* **Redo** the [installation](https://github.com/ArmynC/ArminC-AutoExec#installation) steps, that's mostly a **new download**.
* _After setup_, **change your preference** settings back.

-- This _config_ is **updated often**, so make sure you **come back** here to **check** for **updates**.
